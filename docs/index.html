# Emerging Food Trends for Upscale Country Club Menus
**December 2025 Trend Report**

Based on extensive research across TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest, and industry sources, here are the most promising "rising phase" trends for your affluent, social-media-savvy clientele.

---

## **1. Hot Honey Cottage Cheese Protein Bowls**

- **Platform:** TikTok (primary), Instagram (secondary)
- **Velocity:** **Rising** — "Hot honey cottage cheese sweet potato beef bowl," a dish that took TikTok by storm in 2025, topped Google's charts as the most searched recipe of the year.
- **The Hook:** This trend hits the "healthy but indulgent" sweet spot perfectly. The bowl has an impressive 38 grams of protein and 7 grams of fiber, making it a powerhouse meal for anyone trying to eat more high-protein meals. The unexpected combination—sweet, savory, spicy, creamy—creates that "you have to try this" conversation factor.
- **Country Club Adaptation:** *Elevated Southwestern Bowl* — Roasted sweet potato medallions, grass-fed beef tenderloin tips with house taco seasoning, Vermont-style whole milk cottage cheese mousse, avocado rose, micro cilantro, finished with house-made hot honey drizzle
- **Plating Notes:** The creamy cottage cheese against the taco-seasoned beef, the caramelized edges of the sweet potatoes, and that spicy-sweet honey combo create contrasting textures and temperatures — cold cottage cheese with warm components. Use a wide, shallow bowl; create distinct sections for each component; drizzle hot honey tableside for drama

## **2. Salted Tahini Honeycomb Latte**

- **Platform:** TikTok (viral origin), Instagram, café menus
- **Velocity:** **Rising rapidly** — "For 2025, we predicted that coffee culture would continue to evolve with globally inspired flavors – and tahini is a great example of that shift," according to Yelp Trend Expert Tara Lewis. Social media posts mentioning tahini coffee have increased by 126% year over year, and there's been a 74% spike in recipes that include tahini in coffee.
- **The Hook:** Maman café's beverage director describes it: "In the ever-evolving coffee world, the more savory, rich flavors are often ignored, but it turns out they really amplify and complement the taste of the espresso in a beautiful way. The salted tahini honey sauce has a lot more depth of flavor from the sesame."
- **Country Club Adaptation:** *Salted Tahini Honeycomb Latte* for brunch service — House-made tahini-honey syrup, double-shot espresso, choice of oat or whole milk, honeycomb garnish, fleur de sel finish. Offer hot or iced.
- **Plating Notes:** The charming café uses a rich house-made tahini sauce, hint of sea salt, and sweet and salty sesame crumbs—along with espresso and choice of milk—to create both hot and iced versions. Serve in elegant glassware; the two-tone color separation is photogenic

## **3. Dubai-Style Chocolate Desserts**

- **Platform:** TikTok (global phenomenon), Instagram, now mainstream restaurants
- **Velocity:** **Peaking but still has legs for upscale execution** — In the UAE alone, over 1.2 million chocolate bars were sold in Q1 2025, according to Gulf News. Within the foodservice sector, the trend has emerged in menu items ranging from the Dubai Chocolate Bar Matcha Latte at Starbucks and the Dubai Chocolate Pistachio Shake by Shake Shack to the Dubai Chocolate Mochi Donut from Paris Baguette.
- **The Hook:** The texture contrast is essential: smooth cream + crunchy filling + glossy chocolate = visual and sensory payoff. That's why the Dubai chocolate bar has become a fix dessert for pregnancy cravings, TikTok bakes, and cafe launches.
- **Country Club Adaptation:** *Dubai Chocolate Pot de Crème* — Layers of pistachio cream, kataifi (crispy phyllo pastry), tahini, covered in Belgian milk chocolate ganache; served warm with salted pistachio tuile
- **Plating Notes:** Think the sweet, crunchy textures of kunafa, the richness of pistachio cream, and the toasted warmth of tahini, all wrapped in silky milk chocolate. Cross-section cuts reveal the stunning layers; bright green pistachio provides Instagram-worthy color contrast

## **4. Ina Garten's Brownie Pudding**

- **Platform:** TikTok (currently viral December 2025)
- **Velocity:** **Rising — very timely** — A video of Garten making the indulgent dessert was resurfaced on TikTok in early November, and videos of users trying the recipe have since racked up millions of views and a seemingly endless supply of rave reviews.
- **The Hook:** The dessert features a crispy, crackly top layer that creators are scraping with spoons in gloriously satisfying close-ups, followed by the dramatic reveal—a molten, lava cake-like interior that's more pudding than brownie. The contrast between textures is mesmerizing.
- **Country Club Adaptation:** *Barefoot Contessa Brownie Pudding* — Individual cast iron skillet portions, Valrhona cocoa, vanilla bean seeds, Framboise liqueur, served with house-made vanilla bean ice cream
- **Plating Notes:** The combination of two chocolatey desserts makes an ultra-comforting treat. Fans spanning generations have been trying this spoonable dessert, and every time, their amazement is palpable. Serve in individual cast iron for tableside drama; the crack-and-scoop is highly shareable on social

## **5. Cherry Coded Cocktails & Flavors**

- **Platform:** Pinterest (predicted trend), Instagram, bars
- **Velocity:** **Rising/Early** — Pinterest has named 'Cherry Coded' as one of its top trends for 2025, with the vibrant color appealing to younger generations. "Gen Z and Millennials will infuse cherries into their makeup, menus and mood boards in the coming year." "Tart is all heart in 2025."
- **The Hook:** This fruity, dark variation of the classic martini is a hit among Millennials and Gen Z. The appeal of cherry martinis lies in their beautiful burgundy color, along with the sweet and tart flavor, coupled with the sophisticated allure of a traditional martini. Cherries have always been a favorite garnish on cocktails: and now they're taking over the cocktail world. Searches for 'cherry martini' are up 80%, according to Pinterest.
- **Country Club Adaptation:** *Black Cherry Martini* — Tart cherry juice, premium vodka, Luxardo maraschino liqueur, expressed lemon twist; *Cherry Blossom Spritz* (non-alcoholic option) — Cherry bitters, sparkling water, hibiscus syrup
- **Plating Notes:** A deep red cocktail topped with cocktail cherries is both playful and elegant. The deep burgundy-red color photographs beautifully; garnish with Luxardo cherries on elegant pick

## **6. Elevated Rebel Floats & Nostalgic Soda Creations**

- **Platform:** Pinterest, TikTok
- **Velocity:** **Rising/Early** — Pinterest saw a 105% jump in searches for "cream soda aesthetic" and a 90% boost in soda drinks recipes searches.
- **The Hook:** Pinterest trend-casters think things will veer off from tradition and get inventive. Try a Shirley Temple float, butterbeer float, or mimosa float. For an adult spin, try a red wine float. It seems 2025 is set to be the year of soda with a healthy dash of nostalgia.
- **Country Club Adaptation:** *Champagne Float* for ladies' luncheon — Vintage-style cream soda with champagne sorbet and edible gold leaf; *Espresso Affogato Float* — Cold brew float with house-made coffee gelato
- **Plating Notes:** Use vintage-style glassware (coupe glasses, vintage parfait glasses); the visual contrast of floating sorbet/ice cream is inherently photogenic; add decorative paper straws

## **7. Mediterranean/Greek-Inspired Plates**

- **Platform:** Instagram, Food Network, Pinterest
- **Velocity:** **Rising** — Food Network staffers rave: "This Greek Sheet Pan Chicken is one of my favorite recipes of the year because it's everything I love in a meal — fresh, flavorful and effortlessly simple. Juicy chicken thighs roast alongside colorful veggies, soaking up the lemony, herby marinade. The drizzle of creamy tzatziki and sprinkle of crumbled feta makes this recipe perfectly satisfying."
- **The Hook:** The flavors of lemon, garlic and za'atar really perk up dishes with the rich-and-tangy labneh taking it over the top and transforming what is usually just another veggie side into the most delicious thing at the table. Middle Eastern flavors (za'atar, labneh, tahini, pistachio) are having a major moment across multiple food categories.
- **Country Club Adaptation:** *Greek Goddess Bowl* — Grilled chicken souvlaki, whipped feta, cucumber-tomato salad, Kalamata olives, za'atar-roasted vegetables, house tzatziki, warm pita
- **Plating Notes:** Bright, colorful ingredients naturally photograph well; the white of feta/tzatziki against vibrant vegetables creates visual pop; serve on ceramic plates with Mediterranean patterns

## **8. Chaos Cakes & Whimsical Dessert Presentations**

- **Platform:** Pinterest, TikTok, Instagram
- **Velocity:** **Rising/Early** — Pinterest says 2025 is the year to ditch perfection and embrace a bit of mess—at least when it comes to cakes. Searches for "rat cake" are up 170% on Pinterest, and "silly cake" are up 115%. Adopt a new method of baking that sparks joy.
- **The Hook:** Pinterest head of global trends Sydney Stanback says: "Forget the 'Pinterest perfect' aesthetic—this trend is all about embracing imperfection and humor in clumsy baking. Think quirky, offbeat designs like 'rat cakes' and silly, personalized creations that celebrate individuality."
- **Country Club Adaptation:** For member events and birthday celebrations: *Signature "Barely Together" Cake* — Intentionally rustic buttercream with scattered fresh flowers, dripped glazes, and artistic imperfection. Theme-specific funny bento cakes for special occasions.
- **Plating Notes:** Instagram's focus on aesthetics drives demand for photogenic dishes like chaos cakes. The "imperfect" look actually requires careful execution; think editorial-style rustic rather than messy; fresh florals and fruit add polish

## **SKIP THESE** (Oversaturated or Declining)

1. **Baked Feta Pasta** — The original baked feta pasta might be TikTok's most famous recipe of all time — it peaked years ago and is now firmly in "every home cook has made this" territory. Your members have seen it.

2. **Dalgona Whipped Coffee** — The Dalgona Coffee trend first exploded during lockdown and has seen revivals but now feels dated and pandemic-era nostalgic rather than fresh.

3. **Basic Charcuterie Boards** — Charcuterie became a social media sensation in 2020 during the pandemic and still remain trending — but standard meat-and-cheese boards are saturated. If you offer charcuterie, it needs a creative twist (breakfast board, dessert board, specific theme).

## **Implementation Notes:**

- **Photography stations:** Consider subtle natural lighting in your dining areas; your clientele will share photos
- **Tableside elements:** Hot honey drizzles, cracking into brownie pudding, pouring floats — all create shareable moments
- **Story-driven menus:** Include brief notes about viral origins ("Inspired by Ina Garten's legendary recipe" or "The TikTok bowl everyone's talking about") — your audience will appreciate the social media literacy
- **Health halo balance:** Many of these trends (protein bowls, Mediterranean flavors, tahini) let you market dishes as "protein-packed" or "wellness-focused" while still feeling indulgent</div>
